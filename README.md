# Scribble!

This was just a fun experiment with convolutional neural networks. We are leveraging Keras/Tensorflow's built-in MNIST digit recognition data to train our neural network.

MNIST is a set of data containing 60,000 images of 10 digits. MNIST also contains a set of 10,000 test images. 

To use this tool: run ```python calc.py``` in your terminal and allow a few minutes for the neural network to train through the dataset (usually 30 seconds depending on your CPU). A window will pop up, as shown below. Draw a number (one digit at a time!) in the gray box, and hit "Save image" **after each entry**. Use the appropriate operator button, and the results window will output an answer. 

PS! Try to scribble neatly :)
